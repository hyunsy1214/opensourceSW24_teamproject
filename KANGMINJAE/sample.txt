The article discusses how US export restrictions to China are affecting South Korean semiconductor companies Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, who produce the majority of HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) globally.

Key points:
1. Samsung Electronics is particularly impacted as they supply HBM to China, with Chinese sales accounting for approximately 20% of their total HBM revenue.

2. SK Hynix is expected to be less affected in the immediate term since they primarily supply HBM to NVIDIA.

3. The South Korean government is monitoring the situation but believes the US export controls will have limited impact on domestic companies. They mentioned they will support semiconductor companies' investments, including infrastructure support for the Yongin cluster.

4. There are concerns about ongoing uncertainties regarding Korean companies' access to the rapidly growing Chinese AI semiconductor market.

The article includes quotes from industry experts and government officials discussing these developments and their implications for the Korean semiconductor industry.
